# ValueOfPi

The Following Project consists of calculating the value of Pi upto 1 Millon Digits.
The value of pi is converged using Nonic Formula in "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borwein%27s_algorithm#Nonic_convergence".
The value is calculated using MPIR Library function in c++.
There is no Cube root functionality in MPIR, hence Newton's method of finding out the cube root is used. "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root_algorithm".
There is a seperate c++ code in the repository to explain the Newtons method to find the cube Root.
